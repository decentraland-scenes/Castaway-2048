**Usage**

Click the treasure chest to open it or to reset the game.

Click and drag in a direction to move all the gems in that direction. If two identical gems are merged, they grow into a more valuable one, keep merging them until you reach one of 2048 value.

If all the spaces are full and you can't free them by merging gems, you loose.
